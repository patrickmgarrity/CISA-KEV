# CISA-KEV
The purpose of this project is to track vulnerabilities that we believe are likely to have been exploited in the wild. Once we have sufficient evidence that meets CISA's Know Exploited Vulnerability catalog requirements, we then submit the vulnerabilities and evidence to CISA.

The research involved with this project solely focuses on Open Source Intelligence(OSINT) data from reputable sources for evidence.
